It is a place where if you can dream it, you can do it: Whether that means skiing indoors, dune-surfing in the desert, or zip-lining above the city. But it is not all glitz and adrenaline-pumping action. Stroll through the winding alleys of Al Fahidi Historical Neighborhood to see what Dubai was like during the mid-19th century. Or visit the Jumeirah Mosque (one of the few mosques open to non-Muslims) and learn about Emirati culture. Spot some street art on Jumeirah Beach Road and grab a bite at a shawarma shop, or spend the day hunting for spices and perfume then round things out with a Michelin-starred meal. You can really do it all and we haveve got more recs, below.', // Add the description of Dubai
